# Travel Chronicles: A Platform for Sharing Travel Routes

**Project Overview**  
*Travel Chronicles* is a platform where users can share walking and travel routes, add notes, tips, and reviews. Users can create their own routes with map markers, specifying the number of participants, food/water supplies, and estimated travel time. The platform helps plan trips, making them more comfortable and safer through community-shared experiences.

## Key Features:
- **Route Creation**: Set map markers, plan time, supplies, and route difficulty.
- **Route Navigation**: Personal mode without publishing or using existing routes with comments and obstacle confirmations.
- **Surveys**: Before, during, and after the route to record tips, photos, and feedback.
- **Route Evaluation**: Rated by difficulty, scenery, and popularity.

*Travel Chronicles* makes route planning and navigation engaging and convenient, connecting travelers through shared experiences and recommendations.
